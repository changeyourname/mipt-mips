{"name":"MIPT-MIPS","tagline":"Functional and performance simulators for MIPS-based microprocessor","body":"This project is a part of [Intel lab's](http://ilab.fizteh.ru) activity at [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology](http://phystech.edu/about/aboutmipt.html) (MIPT). The project is being developed by a group of students under the guidance of Intel employees.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to teach the students the computer architecture through development of a microprocessor implementing the [MIPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS32) instruction set in both functional and performance simulators.\r\n\r\nMore information about MIPT Intel lab history and goals is available on [website](http://mipt.ru/drec/about/ilab/about.php) (in Russian).\r\n\r\n## Course materials\r\n\r\nHere you may find lectures on the computer architecture, which are read in 2015 year:\r\n\r\nWeek № | Date | Lectures, practicums and tests | Links | Homework\r\n:----: | :--: | ------------------------------ | ----- | ------------------------\r\n1 | 19 Sep | L1: Project intro | [PPTX](https://github.com/MIPT-ILab/mipt-mips/blob/master/2015/Lecture_1__19_Sep__Project_Introduction__Rus_text__Rus_audio.pptx?raw=true) |\r\n2 | 26 Sep | P1: Basics of Simulator Development | [PPTX](https://github.com/MIPT-ILab/mipt-mips/blob/master/2015/Practice_1__26_Sep__Basics_of_Simulator_Development__Eng_text__No_audio.pptx?raw=true) | Commit your name into members.txt file.

Usually, it is marked with phrase _\"Rus/End audio\"_ near a link in the table above. Those presentations that contain narrations can be played in [MS Powerpoint](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint/) as an ordinary video (we have verified it in Powerpoint 2010).\r\n\r\nTo start playing select the following values in the checkboxes on _Slide Show_ tab (point 1):\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MIPT-ILab/mipt-mips/master/pictures/how_to_play_narrations_in_powerpoint.png)\r\n\r\nThen click _From Beginning_ button (point 2), which starts the presentation with audio and automatic animations from the first foil. You also can start this mode from any slide, pause it and so on. If you want to look the presentation without animations and audio just deselect the checkboxes.\r\n\r\n## Course repo\r\n\r\nIn our [production repo](https://github.com/MIPT-ILab/mipt-mips-2015) you may find C++ sources required to complete this year course assignments — implementation of MIPS simulator.\r\n\r\nThat repo has a lot of useful [Wiki manuals](https://github.com/MIPT-ILab/mipt-mips-2015/wiki) about Git, MIPS, C++, Make utilites and so on.\r\n\r\n## Useful books and materials\r\n### Microprocessor Arch/uArch\r\n\r\n * *[Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface, Patterson D.A., Hennessy J.L., 3rd Edition](http://lib.mipt.ru/book/267604/) (Eng)* -- the main book for this course. It contains all that you need to know about the computer architecture and MIPS ISA.\r\n * *[Computer Architecture Online Course by David Wentzlaff](https://www.coursera.org/course/comparch) at [coursera.org](http://www.coursera.org) (Eng)* -- one of the best online course on Computer Architecture.\r\n\r\n### Programming\r\n\r\n * *[C++ manual, Herbert Schildt, 3rd edition](http://lib.mipt.ru/book/27518/)* (Rus) -- this is the main book for studing C++ in this project. The complexity growths from the zero level, thus, even if you don't know C you can learn C++ using this book.\r\n * *[The C programming language, Kernighan B.W., Ritchie D.M.](http://lib.mipt.ru/book/266005)* (Rus) -- although we are working mostly with C++, some elegant solutions can be made with \"pure C\", which means \"K&R C\".\r\n * *[Asim: A Performance Model Framework](http://www.ckluk.org/ck/papers/asim_ieeecomputer.pdf)* (Eng) is a paper about framework for CPU performance modeling, including features that we're reusing for MIPT-MIPS simulator.\r\n\r\n### MIPS\r\n\r\n * *[MIPS Instruction Reference](http://www.mrc.uidaho.edu/mrc/people/jff/digital/MIPSir.html)* -- the detailed list of MIPS instructions.\r\n * *[MIPS Instruction Converter](http://www.mipshelper.com/mips-converter.php)* -- the good tool investigate MIPS instruction encoding.\r\n * *[MARS Syscalls Funstions](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/help/syscallhelp.html)* -- system calls that are implemented in MARS MIPS simulator and we re-use\r\n\r\n## About us\r\n### Brief changes history\r\n\r\n * 2009/2010: Alexandr Titov and Nikolay Kosarev have started \"MDSP simulator\" project to create light version of functional and clock-precise simulators of a microprocessor optimized for digital signal processing (DSP) for MIPT students education.\r\n * 2010/2011: MDSP simulator has been continued by Alexandr Titov, Yuriy Baida and Grigory Rechistov.\r\n * 2011/2012: New mentor team consisted of Alexander Titov and Pavel Kryukov has taken direction to making course more about theory than simulation.\r\n * 2012/2013: Complicated MDSP ISA has been changed to more common MIPS and project got its current pun name \"MIPT-MIPS\".\r\n * 2013/2014 — 2014/2015: Alexandr and Pavel continued MIPT-MIPS project, adding new lectures material and assignments.\r\n * 2015/2016: Project moves from GoogleCode SVN to GitHub. The new mentors team consists of Pavel Kryukov and Igor Smirnov.\r\n\r\n### Current mentors\r\n\r\n[Pavel Kryukov](https://github.com/pavelkryukov) | [Igor Smirnov](https://github.com/igorsmir-ilab) \r\n:----: | :----:\r\n![](https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/11466405?s=150) | ![](https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13997956?s=150) \r\n\r\n### Special thanks\r\n\r\nWe're very pleased to thank everybody who worked together with us on this project as a mentor:\r\n\r\n  * Nikolay Kosarev (2009/2010)\r\n  * [Yuriy Baida](https://github.com/megabyde) (2010/2011)\r\n  * [Grigory Rechistov](https://github.com/grigory-rechistov) (2010/2011)\r\n  * Alexandr Titov (2009/2010 — 2014/2015)\r\n\r\nOur special thanks are dedicated to MIPT-Intel laboratory staff who makes our work with student possible and efficient:\r\n\r\n  * Ivan Sidorenko (2009/2010)\r\n  * Evgeny Paramonov (2010/2011 — 2013/2014)\r\n  * Oksana Gareeva (2014/2015 — now)\r\n\r\n*Pavel and Igor*","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
